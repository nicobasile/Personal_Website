### Note: I've stopped updating my personal website and am using the time saved to continue working on other projects.

My personal website is a showcase all of my best projects, skills, and accomplishments.

Check it out: http://www.nicobasile.com/ (Currently Down)


Skills learned: Ruby, AWS and Heroku for web hosting, HTML/CSS and general Design principles.



##### After reading about the lack of impact/importance a personal website has on job applications, I've decided to commit more of my time on learning and developing new skills.
